            <h4>Dumbbell deadlift</h4></center>
            <p>The deadlift is performed by squatting down and lifting a weight off the floor with the hand until standing up straight again. Grips can be face down or opposing with one hand down and one hand up, to prevent dropping. Face up should not be used because this puts excess stress on the inner arms. This is a compound exercise that also involves the glutes, lower back, lats, trapezius (neck) and, to a lesser extent, the hamstrings and the calves. Lifting belts are often used to help support the lower back. The deadlift has two common variants, the Romanian deadlift and the straight-leg-deadlift. Each target the lower back, glutes and the hamstrings differently.<br />
            <u><font color="blue">Equipment:</font></u><br />
                 Dumbbells, barbell, trapbar or Smith machine.<br />
            <u><font color="blue">Major variants:</font></u><br />
                 Sumo (wider stance to emphasise the inner thighs); stiff legged (emphasizes hamstrings); straight-legged deadlift (emphasizes lower back).

            <h4>Standing calf raise</h4></center>
                   <p> The standing calf raise is performed by plantarflexing the feet to lift the body. If a weight is used, then it rests upon the shoulders, or is held in the hand(s). This is an isolation exercise for the calves; it particularly emphasises the gastrocnemius muscle, and recruits the soleus muscle.<br />
           <u><font color="blue"> Equipment:</font></u><br />
                Body weight, dumbbells, smartbells, doorbells, cowbells, bell peppers, barbell, Smith machine or standing calf raise machine.<br />
            <u><font color="blue">Major variants:</font></u><br />
                One leg (the other is held off the ground); donkey calf raise (bent over with a weight or machine pad on the lower back).

            <h4>Dumbbell fly</h4></center>
                   <p> The chest fly is performed while lying face up on a bench or standing up, with arms outspread holding weights, by bringing the arms together above the chest. This is a compound exercise for the pectorals. Other muscles worked include deltoids, triceps, and forearms.<br />
                <u><font color="blue">Equipment:</font></u><br />
                        dumbbells, cable machine or "pec deck" machine.<br />
                   <u><font color="blue">Major variants:</font></u><br />
                        incline ~ (more emphasis on the upper pectorals), decline ~ (more emphasis on the lower pectorals), cable crossover.

            <h4>Bent-over row</h4></center>
                   <p>The bent-over row is performed while leaning over, holding a weight hanging down in one hand or both hands, by pulling it up towards the abdomen. This is a compound exercise that also involves the biceps, forearms, traps, and the rear deltoids. The torso is unsupported in some variants of this exercise, in which case lifting belts are often used to help support the lower back.<br />
                    •	<u><font color="blue">Equipment:</font></u><br />
                        dumbbell, barbell, Smith machine or T-bar machine.<br />
                    •	<u><font color="blue">Major variants:</font></u><br />
                        cable row (using a cable machine while seated).

            <h4>Bent-over row</h4></center>
                   <p>The lateral raise (or shoulder fly) is performed while standing or seated, with hands hanging down holding weights, by lifting them out to the sides until just below the level of the shoulders. A slight variation in the lifts can hit the deltoids even harder, while moving upwards, just turn the hands slightly downwards, keeping the last finger higher than the thumb. This is an isolation exercise for the deltoids. Also works the forearms and traps.<br />
	<u><font color="blue">Equipment: </font></u><br />
        dumbbells, cable machine or lateral raise machine.<br />
	<u><font color="blue">Major variants:</font></u><br />
        front raise (lift weights out to the front; emphasis is on the front deltoids), bent-over ~ (emphasis is on the rear deltoids), 180 degree lateral raise (weights are held slightly in front of the body and lifted over the head in a circular motion).

            <h4>Pectorals (chest)</h4></center>
                   <p>The bench press or dumbbell bench-press is performed while lying face up on a bench, by pushing a weight away from the chest. This is a compound exercise that also involves the triceps and the front deltoids, also recruits the upper and lower back muscles, and traps. The bench press is the king of all upper body exercises and is one of the most popular chest exercises in the world. It is the final exercise in 'The big 3'.
	        <u><font color="blue">Equipment: </font></u><br /> 
                       dumbbells, barbell, Smith machine or bench press machine.
	        <u><font color="blue">Major variants:</font></u><br />
                       incline ~ (more emphasis on the upper pectorals), decline ~ (more emphasis on the lower pectorals), narrow grip ~ (more emphasis on the triceps), push-up (face down using the body weight), neck press (with the bar over the neck, to isolate the pectorals), vertical dips (using parallel dip bars) or horizontal dips (using two benches with arms on the near bench and feet on the far bench, and dropping the buttocks to the floor and pushing back up.)
